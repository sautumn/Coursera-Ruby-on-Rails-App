# Coursera-Ruby-on-Rails-App
This small app was created as a part of the Coursera Introduction to Ruby on Rails course which utilizes the Coursera API. I completed and tweaked the project in an effort to learn more about ruby on rails, RESTful API's using HTTParty, git, deployment to Heroku, javascript, jquery, bootstrap, and HTML/CSS. Thanks for looking!

Deployed on Heroku : https://guarded-tor-2571.herokuapp.com/
